This is [Microverse's](https://www.microverse.org/) final project for the Javascript section.

In this project I implemented an RPG game using [Phaser 3](http://phaser.io/tutorials), an open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games.
This project's objective was to build a platform game similar [GameDev Academy](https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-1/).The main objective was to use the tutorial create my own role play game.

- You will then be directed to the battle scene and here you will fight against two enemies in each round.
- You will use the arrows still to dodge the attacks and the space bar to launch attack
- Enjoy


## Design and thinking
This is a turn based role play game. The objective of this game is to give players a chance to enjoy a fun but also leveling game to give them a feel of progression and at the same time challenge as they fight the different characters dubbed as enemies.

This is how I designed my game: 
- In the first two days, I had a lot of ideas for a game in my mind. I thought of creating this cool 3D game with characters fighting but I ended up creating a game where there are two game characters on one side fighting enemies on the other side. 
- I however, lost sometime in between and when I was able to catchup, I continued with the design process. 
- I decided to name my game Ultimate Ninja because the name sounded cool for a turn based game especially with characters fighting.
- I used the available sprites, images and sounds from [openGame Art](https://opengameart.org)

The game comprises of two scenes. That is the World Scene which has one player. To navigate through this scene, a player has to use the arrows ![screenshot](build/assets/pointers.png) to navigate through this scene. During the design process, my thinking was that the enemies are hiding and the player has to navigate through to look for them.

The battle Scene is where the action takes place and to dodge attack, we still use ![screenshot](build/assets/pointers.png) arrows. 

The more the levels you win, the higher the score!.


#### players-characters

These are your player characters and you will interact with them very often.

##### Prospector
You will find this one in the worldScene and he is the one you will use to look for the enemies.

##### Ninja ![screenshot](build/assets/ninja.jpg)
This is your most powerful player and you ought to guard him well. He hits the enemy with a damage of **150** and **80 Hp**

##### Herus ![screenshot](build/assets/alienHero2.jpg)
This one is your weakest  and only hits with **50 damage** and **200 Hp**. But he can also handle more attack from the enemy than **Ninja**



#### Enemies
These are the characters that you are fighting against.

##### wizarus form 1 ![screenshot](build/assets/wizard1.png)

You will meet him in level one of this game. He has **80 damage** and **80 Hp**. He takes more than one shape so lookout!

##### wizarus form 2 ![screenshot](build/assets/wizard2.png)
You will also meet him in level one but its also possible to meet him in level two. He has **90 damage** and **90 Hp**

##### wizarus form 3 ![screenshot](build/assets/wizard3.png)

You will meet him in level two and he is more powerful than the first two enemies  **110 damage** and **100 Hp**

##### ghostus ![screenshot](build/assets/kiranga.png)

You will find him in level 3 of this game. He is very powerful with  **120 damage** and **150 Hp**

##### Master ![screenshot](build/assets/master.png)

This is the strongest and most powerful of all the enemies so you will definately want to defeat him! He has **150 damage** and **200 Hp**
