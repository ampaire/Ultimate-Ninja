[![Contributors][contributors-shield]][contributors-url]

<br />

This is Microverse's final project for the Javascript section.

In this project I implemented an RPG game using [Phaser 3](http://phaser.io/tutorials), an open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games.

## About

This project's objective was to build a platform game similar [GameDev Academy](https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-1/).The main objective was to use the tutorial create my own role play game.

## How to play the game
- Enter your name and click on the start button
- You will be directed to the world Scene
- Use the left, right, up and down arrows to navigate through the scene
- You will then be directed to the battle scene and here you will fight against two enemies in each round.
- You will use the arrows still to dodge the attacks and the space bar to launch attack
- Enjoy
