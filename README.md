<br />

This is Microverse's final project for the Javascript section.

In this project I implemented an RPG game using [Phaser 3](http://phaser.io/tutorials), an open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games.

## About

This project's objective was to build a platform game similar [GameDev Academy](https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-1/).The main objective was to use the tutorial create my own role play game.
